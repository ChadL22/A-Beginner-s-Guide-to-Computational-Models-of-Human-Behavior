# Expected Utility Theory (EUT)

## 📌 Overview
Expected Utility Theory (EUT) is a fundamental model in decision theory that describes how rational agents evaluate choices under uncertainty.

## 📖 Mathematical Equation
$$EU(A) = \sum_{i} p_i U(x_i)$$
Where:
- \( A \) = Action or choice.
- \( p_i \) = Probability of outcome \( i \).
- \( U(x_i) \) = Utility of outcome \( x_i \).

## 🔍 Example
A person must choose between:

1. A **50% chance** to win $100.
2. A **100% chance** to win $40.

Using EUT:

- **Option 1**: $$EU = (0.5 \times 100) + (0.5 \times 0) = 50$$
- **Option 2**: $$EU = (1.0 \times 40) = 40$$

A risk-neutral individual would prefer **Option 1**.
